# Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction Model
This project implements a Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) prediction model using Python, leveraging advanced statistical methods and machine learning techniques.
<br/>

**Project Overview:**
<br/>
The CLV prediction model aims to estimate the total value a customer will bring to a business over their entire relationship. This project utilizes historical customer data to predict future purchasing behavior and monetary value.
<br/>

**Key Features**
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Implementation of Gamma-Gamma and Beta-Geometric/NBD models
- Random Forest Regressor for CLV prediction
- Feature importance analysis
- Data visualization for customer segmentation and CLV distribution
- Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
<br/>

**Model Components**
1. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values and feature engineering
2. Gamma-Gamma Model: Estimating customer monetary value
3. Beta-Geometric/NBD Model: Predicting customer purchase behavior
4. Random Forest Regressor: Predicting overall Customer Lifetime Value
5. Feature Importance Analysis: Identifying key factors influencing CLV
<br/>

**Results**
<br/>
The model successfully predicts Customer Lifetime Value, enabling:
- Targeted marketing strategies
- Improved customer retention efforts
- Efficient allocation of marketing resources
- Personalized customer engagement
<br/>

**Future Improvements**
<br/>
- Incorporate additional data sources for more accurate predictions
- Experiment with other machine learning algorithms for comparison
- Develop a web application for easy CLV prediction by non-technical users
